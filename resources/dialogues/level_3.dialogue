	Richard: Salut. I got your document. Thanks a lot for that. I need more however.

	Richard: Hmph, the useless guy. Bonjour, I guess. We got new rules today. 
Richard: By the way I must say I'm impressed by your performance.
Richard: Non really, the previous schmucks at your position didn't last as long as you.
- That's what she said, Richard!
	Richard: HAHAHA. Oh you, you're one of the good ones, you know?
- Thank you Sir! Means a lot.
	Richard: No problem, but easen up dude. We're all just like a big family here, you know?
Richard: Anyway. These fuckers would always let some nonsensical documents pass through to the archives.
Richard: So if it hasn't happened already, burn it or report it when you see some whackery. It's up to your jugement, based on the dangerositÃ©. So analyze them well.
Richard: You can call me Dick by the way. It's my nickname. Dick from DIC! Sounds great doesn't it?
- Uh yeaaah, it sure does Dick!
	Dick from DIC: Great. Back to it. God Bless L'Administration.
- Whatever you say, Sir Boss!
	Sir Boss The Dick: Oh you. You're growing on me, idiot. God Bless L'Administration.
You: God Bless L'Administration! ðŸ«¡

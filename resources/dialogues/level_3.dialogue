Richard : Hey there. We got new rules today. By the way I must say I'm impressed by your performance.
Richard: No really, the previous schmucks at your position didn't last as long as you.
Richard: There would always be some nonsensical documents passing through to the archives.
Richard: So if it hasn't happened already, burn it or report it. It's up to your judgement, depending on the dangerosity.
Richard: You can call me Dick by the way. It's my nickname. Dick from DIC! Sounds great doesn't it?

- Whatever you say, Sir Boss!
	Sir Boss The Dick: Oh you. You're growing on me, idiot. Now work.

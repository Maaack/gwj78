[right]
To L'Administration of Les Unifiés,
For too long have we endured your economical oppression.
For too long have we suffered from your unending schemes.

Far too long is your reach in our country.

Today, we, Tanamians, claim our Indépendance.

All your envoys will be repatriated following this.
All traités and deals are to be renegociated.

We shall not, and will not falter.
